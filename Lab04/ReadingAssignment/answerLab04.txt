Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
CompactDisc, Book, Store and Cart.

If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
ClassCastException will be thrown at runtime. This is because Java does not allow casting an object to a type it does not inherit from or implement.

What class should implement the Comparable interface?
The Media class should implement the Comparable interface because all mentioned media types inherit from it. By this approach, you can define a general ordering for all medias.

In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
Implement the compareTo() method in Media class, starting by comparing title/cost first and then cost/title in case of equality.

Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
No, the Comparable interface only allows for only one way at all.

Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
Just override the method in DigitalVideoDisc, starting by compare length first, then length and cost finally.
